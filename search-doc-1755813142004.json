If your community has its own established enforcement process, be sure to edit this section to describe your own policies.]  If an investigation by the Community Moderators finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, the following enforcement ladder may be used to determine how best to repair harm, based on the incident's impact on the individuals involved and the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may be skipped.  Warning Event: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents.Consequence: A private, written warning from the Community Moderators.Repair: Examples of repair include a private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations. Temporarily Limited Activities Event: A repeated incidence of a violation that previously resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation.Consequence: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown period designed to underscore the seriousness of the situation and give the community members involved time to process the incident. The cooldown period may be limited to particular communication channels or interactions with particular community members.Repair: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering community spaces after the period is over. Temporary Suspension Event: A pattern of repeated violation which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.Consequence: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension. In general, temporary suspensions give the person being suspended time to reflect upon their behavior and possible corrective actions.Repair: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted. Permanent Ban Event: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the Community Moderators determine there is no way to keep the community safe with this person as a member.Consequence: Access to all community spaces, tools, and communication channels is removed. In general, permanent bans should be rarely used, should have strong reasoning behind them, and should only be resorted to if working through other remedies has failed to change the behavior.Repair: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

In vanilla Kubernetes, Prometheus and Grafana are installed from the prometheus-community kube-prometheus-stack helm charts.  Accessing the Metrics UIs‚Äã  If running on OpenShift, skip to OpenShift and Grafana.  Port Forwarding (The Classic Approach)‚Äã  Prometheus (port 9090):  kubectl port-forward -n ibm-monitoring --address 0.0.0.0 svc/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090:9090   Grafana (port 3000):  kubectl port-forward -n ibm-monitoring --address 0.0.0.0 svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80   Access the User Interfaces at:  Prometheus: http://YOUR_IP:9090 (where the metrics live)Grafana: http://YOUR_IP:3000 (where the pretty charts live) - default credentials: admin/admin  Grafana Dashboards (The Eye Candy)‚Äã  Import the IBM services dashboard from the Grafana UI. Go to Dashboards -&gt; New -&gt; Import and prepare to be amazed by the beautiful metrics visualizations!  OpenShift and Grafana (The Enterprise Way)‚Äã  If running on OpenShift with user workload monitoring enabled, you can access the metrics through the OpenShift console:  Navigate to the OpenShift console (your command center)In the left navigation bar, click on &quot;Observe&quot;You can access: Metrics: Click on &quot;Metrics&quot; to view and query metrics using the built-in Prometheus UITargets: Click on &quot;Targets&quot; to see all monitored endpoints and their status  The metrics are automatically integrated into the OpenShift monitoring stack (because integration is everything).  Security Note (The Serious Stuff)‚Äã  When running in a cloud environment, make sure to:  Configure your security groups to allow inbound traffic on monitoring portsUse proper authentication for production environments (no &quot;admin/admin&quot; in prod!)Consider setting up TLS certificates for secure communicationRotate your API keys regularly (security hygiene is important)Monitor your monitoring (meta, we know)  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Troubleshooting (When Things Go Sideways ü§™)‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started with IBM via the Quick Start installer","url":"/project-documentation-template/docs/guide/Installation/quickstart#troubleshooting-when-things-go-sideways-","content":" The various IBM container images can take some time to download depending on your connectivity (patience, young Padawan).
